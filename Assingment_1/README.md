<h1>BrainFuck-Interpreter</h1>
<p>A simple BrainFuck Interpreter in Python created using Visual Studio Code.</p>


<p>Brainfuck was created by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993 in an attempt to create a language 
with the smallest possible compiler. The compiler for this language takes only 240 bytes 
and it achieves this by only using eight simple commands: <, >, +, -, [, ], . and ,
</p>
Despite the simplicity of the Brainfuck lexicon, it is one of the most confusing programming 
languages out there due to the massive amount of code needed to execute a simple 
program or task.

<h2>Commands</h2>

Each commands consist of a single charaacter:

#### Character Meaning

1. > increment the data pointer (to point to the next right cell in memory).
2. < decrement the data pointer (to point to the next left cell in memory).
3. '+' increment the data pointer by 1.
4. '-' decrement the data pointer by 1.
5. . output the current pointed cell in memory.
6. , accept one byte of input to storing in memory.
7.[  if the current cell is zero, the instruction pointer will jump to the matching ] (think while loop)
8. ] if the current cell is nonzero, jump back to the matching ] in the instructions .
